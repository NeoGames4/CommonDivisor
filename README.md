# CommonDivisor
Simple Java program for determining the best-fit common divisor of several values (including floating point numbers also permitted) by brute forcing threw a given interval.
It is neither optimized for efficiency nor checked for correctness.
The algorithm does not take size ratios and uncertainties into account.
It is therefore recommended that you critically check the results for plausibility yourself.
I created the algorithm for my use case just to solve my problem as quickly and easily as I could.
